# Base project for disbotter

To start working with disbotter, you just need to use this template and start coding!
Everything is based on discord.js, and example commands are provided in the `commands` folder.

## Notes

This project uses NodeNext modules, so imports need to have file extensions. For example, `import { Command } from './command'` becomes `import { Command } from './command.js'`.
